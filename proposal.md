## Find Waldo - the Minigame!
I wanted to create a game that I felt reflected a lot of the things we learned with images and pygame, as those were the most fun.
Hopefully I can create a fun quick experience for everyone who plays along!
You will look through a image of where's waldo and click on him when you see him to win the game.
I'm hoping to feature a loading screen, a win screen, and at least one Where's Waldo puzzle picture.
I belive the loading and win screen will be new challanges for me, as nothing like that was covered in our notes or learning.
Therefore, most of my research will go into that.
The most ideal otucome for this game would be that everytime you press play, you'd be loaded into a random Where's waldo map to play.
The minimum which is the most important to accomplish will be just having one map work, as I can't predict how long the loading and win screens will take to implement. 
First week, probably importing the images and making sure they appear on screen and work, and maybe the basic pygame elements
Second week, researching and implementing the start/win screen (hopefully similar processes)
Third week, making the transtition between the different screens work as well as an effect when Waldo is found.
