# Where-s-Waldo-
A short game based on the classic kids book "where's waldo?"
https://github.com/gaelvdl/empty 

This file is a short Where's Waldo game that's just a for fun experiment.
Nothing too crazy for this one, just load up into the program, find waldo and get out.
There is menu implementation, videos on top of images, and a quick game menu loop.
For the future if i were to ever revisit this project, there could possibly be mulitple levels implemented, as well as music or sound effects.
Load the game up and play a quick round of Where's Waldo, find the right one, point and click and you win!
