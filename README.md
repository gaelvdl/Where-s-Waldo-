## Description
A short game based on the classic kids book "where's waldo?"

This file is a short "Where's Waldo" game that's just a for fun experiment.
Nothing too crazy for this one, just load up into the program, find waldo and get out.
There is menu implementation, videos on top of images, and a quick game menu loop.
For the future if i were to ever revisit this project, there could possibly be mulitple levels implemented, as well as music or sound effects.
Load the game up and play a quick round of Where's Waldo, find the right one, point and click and you win!

There was a few libraries used in order to both create the main menu screen as well as the video.
The first go was going to use a gif, but that proved too complicated and time consuming.
Instead, I used a cv2 library to implement a raw video into the program.
I also have a def that controls the menu, and a def that controls the main game loop.

This project was a mixture of revisiting old notes, using the duck ai provided in the syllabus, and mostly scowering through libraries.
There were other libraries I considered using and spent a lot of time looking through different ones to use different methods.
I think the one I went with in the end though was the best choice for me personally.

Thank you, and I hope you enjoy this short game!
